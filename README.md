# The Toilet Exchange

The **Toilet Exchange** is a chaotic, tongue-in-cheek Discord stock-trading simulator where players buy, sell, and crash fake companies in a volatile market run by chaos and bad decisions.

Prices move automatically. Fortunes rise and fall. You might become the richest trader in the server‚Ä¶ or lose everything in a glorious toilet-flush of economic disaster.

## üß† Development Notes

- Stock prices update automatically via a background task.

- Price movement scales with volatility ‚Äî low-risk stocks move slightly, high-risk ones swing wildly.

- Prices can never fall below $0.01, and low-value stocks have a slightly higher chance of recovery.

## ü™ô Planned Features

- Add/Change Admins: Allow servers to add custom bot admins without requiring Discord server admin permissions.

- Low-Value Stock Recovery System: Give penny stocks a fairer chance to recover from long-term stagnation.

- Market News that shows an overview of market activity for the day/week/month.

- Server Customization: Allow each server to fine-tune update rates, risk multipliers, and more.
